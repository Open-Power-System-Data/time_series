Both report \"total load\", which is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${total \\ load} = total \\ generation - auxilary/self-consumption \\ in \\ power \\ plants + imports - exports - consumption \\ by \\ storages$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The two sources differ Values on PS (~500 TWh annaually in Germany) are usually slightly higher than on the TP (~490 TWh). \n",

For the PS, the data is published with a delay of up to 3 months, which might allow for more accurate metering. For a comparison of the two sources see [Hirth, et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.048).\n",
    "\n",
    "For some countries, the PS report a [\"represenativity factor\"](https://docstore.entsoe.eu/Documents/Publications/Statistics/Specific_national_considerations.pdf#page=6) (91% in Germany until 2014, 97% since then), indicating that the reported values would have to be upscaled by this value resulting in ~520 TWh annually in Germany. \n",

    "[Schuhmacher & Hirth (2015)](http://services.feem.it/userfiles/attach/20151191122284NDL2015-088.pdf#page=11) compare the German hourly load total load values to monthly and yearly aggregate consumption statistics for Germany, showing considerable differences, part of which may be explained by the fact that none of th ENTSO-E data cover industrial auto generation which is not transported over the transmission grid."
